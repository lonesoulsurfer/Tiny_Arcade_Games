#Tiny Arcade Games

I've recently taken the leap into playing around with microcontrollers, specifically the 8 bit ATtiny85 and so far it's been a blast!

There are 7 different games that you can play and I've also created a custom keyring style mini PCB to add the components to.

For those new to ATtiny microcontrollers, It is a small, integrated, 8 pin IC, similar to the Arduino, but with much less IO pins, smaller memory and a smaller form factor. Don't let the smallness of the IC fool you, ATtiny85 microcontroller can perform a whole bunch of different functions on a single IC once it has been programmed. In this project we will be programming it with some arcade games.

Don't worry if you a totally new to all of this. I have created this project with beginners in mind so if you have some basic soldering skills and a computer you shouldn't have any issues building your own. I've used through hole components and off-the-shelf parts which you can buy cheaply from Ali-Express etc.

I've also published a repository in GutHub on how to program an ATtiny 85 which you can find here: https://github.com/lonesoulsurfer/ATtiny_85_Programmer

The games available are your classic arcade games like Frogger, Space Attack, Breakout, Snake, Pong, and others. It still blows my mind that you can fit a whole game into one of these tiny IC's!

Here is a video of the games in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKiPz_Yv8tA&feature=youtu.be
